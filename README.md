https://coolors.co/palette/03045e-023e8a-0077b6-0096c7-00b4d8-48cae4-90e0ef-ade8f4-caf0f8

###### THINGS TO DO

Minor bugs:

- Frontend: Empty entries have no titles and they return the entry box
- Frontend: Date should be written in a different format
- Frontend: Entry box should scroll down within the box
- Frontend: Paragraphs don't exist
- Backend: create error handling when no valid id is sent to getOneEntry (avoid app to crash)

Backend:

- DONE: Create the backend folder structure
- DONE: Think of the methods: get and post
- DONE: Set up a database in mongoDB
- DONE: do a schema for my-log database
- DONE: create a basic database by using POSTMAN and PUT
- DONE: set up GET and POST methods to work properly
- DONE: have a look at the rest of project 1 by john smilga
- DONE: implement the getOne with id parameter
- DONE: make the getOne find the right json object in the database
- DONE: adapt frontend to receive data from database (with axios library?)
- DONE: Implement get one entry in the log (IT WASN'T NEEDED, I CAN HANDLE IT WITHOUT THE SERVER, BECAUSE DATA HAS BEEN FETCHED ALREADY)
- DONE: Implement put for entries in the log
- DONE: Implement delete
- Implement patch
- Implement token and password
- Correct timestamp
- Correct id/index
- Build and deploy app (take care of dotenv)
- Implement error handler
- Implement different pages for more than 5 entries
- Implement validators

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
